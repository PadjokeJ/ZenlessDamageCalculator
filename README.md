# Zenless Damage Calculator

This repo contains the damage calculations source code for all the damage calculations used by [Interknot](https://interknot.space).

## Source

All the calculations follow the formulas found [in this google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vSo82Ac3HqdI_G5_BoAqYJToK6LX4FGLPJxjPZEbhMQ-wSyFyxDFl1dr8i5czcCLJmYwxWfsXkCXN6v/pub), and in the [zzz wiki](https://zenless-zone-zero.fandom.com/wiki/Damage).  
All character substats can be found with [your enka cards](https://enka.network) if you want to replicate the damage calculations on interknot. If a formula returns a different result either dm me on discord (padjokej), or submit a [github issue](https://github.com/PadjokeJ/ZenlessDamageCalculator/issues).
